They're not really meant to be shared, but I have it public to show that I'm actively coding.

# yt-dlp python script
yt-dlp script is meant to automate and format videos I download from YouTube. If it's paid content, then it will ask what browser you use from the list of supported browsers that yt-dlp accepts and grab the cookies with yt-dlp cookies command. Again these are meant for my use cases.
